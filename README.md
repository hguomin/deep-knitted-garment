# Deep-knitted-garment
Research project for creating knitted garment 3D model from single 2D image using deep learning.

# Method
## Garment template generation based on SMPL model
Use SMPL model and edit it in Blender to get the garment template mesh, and create the mapping relationship between the human model vertices and the garment template mesh vertices to calculate the displacement between human model and garment.
